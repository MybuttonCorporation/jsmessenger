$ Bugfixes
 [-] Removed: (jsmessenger/util/base).util.run_jsm_task() returning 'undefined'
  +-> INFO: any parameters with the character (") will be removed due to argument parsing. Please use (') or (`) as chars instead.
  +--> Shown Error: [arg] is undefined
 [-] Removed: (jsmessenger/app/init).channel_nc, (jsmessenger/app/init).channel_fc
  +-> REASON: To maintain two channel presence codebases the same is too much of a task to be completed in every update. Instead, a new file (jsmessenger/app/showChannel) now has a function for showing and presencing a channel. Changes are applied to both channels.
 [+] Added (jsmessenger/app/showChannel)
 [-] Some messages do not have the ('>>') mark on them when sent.
 [-] Random colored messages when sending to a channel.
